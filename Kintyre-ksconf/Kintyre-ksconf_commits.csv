Previously the ""promote"" subcommand was called ""patch"".  I thought this could
lead to some confusion.  Typically the source file in a ""patch"" operation
remains untouched by the patching process (and can be reverted and re-done if
necessary.  However, that's not what happens here.  The idea is to ""promote""
(move) settings from the local file to a default file.  And in this case, we
don't want the local file to retain the same settings as the default file (as
that could mask further changes made via version control; the assumption here
is that 'default' is version controlled.)  Therefore, the rename ""promote""
seemed more appropriate.

- Implemented first pass of ""promote"" functionality.  Right now only the
  automatic (non-interactive) version has been implemented.  Started taking
  notes on what interactive mode should look like (borrowing heavily from the
  git ""--patch"" mode.)

Completed a very rough and ugly interactive version of the promote subcommand.

no means of jumping/skipping/searching/editing.  Diff formatting is unreadable.

Revamped the core diff function `compare_cfgs()` to return namedtuples instead
of plain tuples for the `location` field.  Also made it possible to prevent the
entire file from being returned as a single giant diff by passing in the
`allow_level0` argument.  (Also renumbered the ""layers"", but this only impacted
the comments.  Now the layer numbers are listed consistently everywhere.)

Added directory support to 'promote'.  If target is a directory, the basename
of the source is simply added to the target.  This allows a user so simply
point to ""default"" as the target.  (Saves keystrokes when running multiple
promote commands back-to-back.)

Created code for the 'unarchive' command.  It supports extracting from both
compressed tarballs (.tar.gz/.tgz/.spl) as well as extracting zip files.
Both install and upgrade operations are supported and automatically detected.
When the destination is a git working tree then a reasonable attempt is made
to make sure the destination is clean to prevent loss of local work.
Several sanity checking levels exist to vary how strict the clean check is.
Also, there are several git modes where the user can control is the app is
simply extracted to the working tree, if the working tree changes should be
staged, and if the staged changes should be automatically committed.

Additionally, the unarchive command supports:  (1) Renaming of the app being
installed.  (A few automatic renaming rules are in place, but primarily this is
a CLI feature.)  (2) Exclusion rules for unwanted content (3) Support for app
that ship with ""local"" files, (4) renaming of the 'default' folder, this if for
use with the 'ksconf combine' mode.

More work on the 'unarchive' subcommand is likely, but this seems good enough
for a first pass.

typical ""diff"" header to the start of each diff output (helpful for combine's

hook related notes (handy reference, for now)

Added '--dry-run' modes for both 'merge' and 'combine' modes.  Instead of
applying changes, any modifications that would be made are shown as a 'diff'.

a9675bb72f30bb767c6ce7f85a1b248b1ff4ec09,"Add conf parsing profiles, a container class, and argparse integration

Updated the parse_conf() interface to accept a 'profile' instead of passing
around a dozen individual parser settings all the time.  For the moment, this
is still implemented as a simple Python dictionary, but eventually this will be
swapped out when the parser itself is overhauled.

Introduced a new 'ConfFileType' class that works as an argparse argument 'type'
that allows an easier integration with with the cli implementation code.  For
example, it's now possible to hand-off simple conf file validation steps to
this new class and therefore skip duplicate implementations of the traditional
""can't read file"", and ""can't parse file"" checks.  Now when either of these
conditions occur, the user is prompted with an error message back from argparse
(before custom CLI code is even called) and consistently across subcommands.

The ConfFileType class works by passing ConfFileProxy objects to the CLI
implementation functions.  These classes also store the appropriate parsing
profile because it's often desirable to vary the parsing features depending on
the nature of the subcommand.  This proxy class provides a simple interface for
reading and writing Splunk .conf files.  Also, because some commands, such as
'minimize' allow a directory to be indicated, instead of a single conf file,
the ConfDirProxy class was created.

Return codes for several subcommands have been tweaked.  This still needs more
work but should at least be a step in the right direction.

- Created many new (mostly trivial) unit tests that focus strictly on CLI
  testing.  Added test for combine, diff, check, sort, unarchive.  Now total
  coverage is reported at 72%.
- Improved the ksconf_cli() testing helper so that when a unit test fails, the
  stdout and/or stderr can be automatically dumped to the console which greatly
  speeds up test case development.  This implementation require switching from
  a simple function to a context manager.  (Because there's no way of knowing
  from the output alone if the test will pass/fail.)
- Created a 'TestWorkingDir' helper class that allows the quick creation of a
  unique testing space where multiple files/directories can be created on the
  fly for CLI unit testing.  This also facilities git repo action (primarily
  used for 'unarchive' at the moment)
- Update RUN_TEST.sh to run the new unittest runner.  Really hoping we can
  drop that script soon.  (It takes nearly a min to run, where as unittests
  take under 2 seconds locally.)
- Added 3 new binary files (the modsecurity TA).  I randomly picked this TA for
  testing because it (1) has multiple versions for download, (2) has a small
  footprint, and (3) doesn't appear to have a license that restrict this type

  end up being the problem I was after, but but didn't seem worth reverting.)
- Fixup exit code for the 'merge' command.

Added first draft of INSTALL documentation that goes beyond the default
'pip install .' option.  Some installations don't have pip, the right version
of python or even Internet access, and while we can't deal with all the issues,
hopefully we can cover some of the basics and give helpful links.

The biggest addition in the install instructions for using embedded python that
ships with Splunk Enterprise.  There's a number of issues with this, as noted
in the docs, but sometimes it's a good option.

The install docs currently make no mention of how to upgrade.  Fairly straight
forward for the pip use case, but others require more thought.  As of now, NONE
of these options are documented.

I also didn't document the standard 'python setup.py install' option as that

    Create entry_point handling fallback mechanism

    Add a new fallback mechanism which required changing the location of the
    'ksconf_cmd' entrypoints once again.  The entrypoints are now stored in a
    temporary data structure from that we generate (1) the setup() parameters for
    packaging, and (2) the fallback mechanism used to load entry points when
    external modules are not installed or before the kintyre-splunk-conf package
    has been installed for the first time.  (The run_test.py and make_cli_docs.py
    scripts are examples of things that weren't working correctly if the package
    wasn't installed.)

    Additionally, there was a bug with Python 3.4/3.5 on Windows where it ignored
    the entry_points defined in 'setup.cfg'.  But it works fine if they are defined
    in setup.py.

    I also refactored the get_endpoints() code into separate functions per method.

    Using entry-points to manage CLI subcommands

    First attempt at using entrypoints to dynamically load individual commands.
    This reorganizes the argparse configuration for the 'ksconf.commands.*' modules
    and allows for external python packages to publish their own commands to the
    ""ksconf"" CLI without editing this package.  (This allows for client-specific
    add-ons, for example.)  Also using this as an opportunity to improve CLI unit
    testing (and possibly other features, like interactive shell mode) by putting
    better wrappers around standard IO and exit() calls.  A logging stub has also
    been introduced, but is not in effect yet.

    Currently 'check' and 'sort' have been migrated to the new framework.  This is
    a working snapshot.

    A caching mechanism around the entry_points collection code was added to speed
    up certain slow activities.

    Add 'snapshot' command

    Introducing a new prototype command for taking a snapshot of one or more .conf
    files and exporting them in an eventually stable export format using JSON. This
    can be used for various purposes including capturing a snapshot for purpose of
    archival or change control review.  Potentially this format could be used to
    ship around conf files when moving full apps or tarballs is undesirable for
    some reason (currently no mechanism exists for reconstructing .conf files from
    this JSON format, but doing so would be trivial.)

* Moving away from the CLI ""--help"" output is the docs mentality.  That just
  too hard to maintain, makes formatting very difficult, and reduces usability.
* Switched to ReStructuredText for all internal docs for much greater
  versatility.  That's now used for (1) core docs, (2) in-line code docs, and
 (3) sparingly used in the CLI help & description strings.
* Using an ""argparse"" addon library to generate the embedded form of
  command-oriented documentation.
* Split docs into 2 main sections:  User manual and reference material.
* Split the install guide into 2 sections.  Advanced stuff should be less
  necessary with the Splunk app install option available to us.
* Tweaked some internal stuff like ""--version"" output.
* Added several more pages of completely fresh content

    Change ReStructuredText indentation :-(

    Big blind commit.  It ALL changed.  Should pay off long term.

    Updated help non-manual formatters to use a custom (ReST-stripping) new custom
    formatter too.

    Did some minor working changes, spelling, and so on...

    AppVeyor build fix

    Not sure why 'six' is all of a sudden needed *before* setup.py completes,
    but whatever.   It's probably automatically installed in Travis.

    Consolidating doc tools and cleaning up '--version' output

    - Consolidated ksconf_subcommands.csv table creation into the make_dyn_docs
      script.
    - Improved '--version' output by suppressing missing info and grouping
      subcommands by python package distribution.
    - Created get_all_ksconf_cmds wrapper service to handle typical entrypoint
      loading needs.  Shared by 2 functions for now.
    - Opportunistic doc format and spelling fixes.

    Merge csv table creation into make_dyn_docs script

    Consolidate csv creation script into the make_dyn_docs script (that used to
    make just the CLI docs).  Did some refactoring and some unicode fixes (Python 2
    vs 3) and lack of support for unicode for the PY2 version, blah blah blah...

    Refactor dynamic docs (CLI) implementation

    - Rename CLI generation script (since it will soon be doing more)
    - Created a new helper to intelligently overwrite files (implemented as a
      context manager to make this easy for the caller to work with.  (Needs unit
      tests, but for now it's exercise frequently during pre-commit hooks, so good
      enough for now.)
    - Improve path handling in docs script (don't allow the wrong version of the
      docs to be generated if the script is run from the wrong path.)

    Docs generation tweaks

    - Removed static table of commands and replaced it with a simple CSV generated
      from a few simple line of Python code (much more maintainable.)
    - Moved all generated files into docs/source/dyn to make a clear distinction
      between what docs should be edited directly vs which are auto-generated.
    - Add a simple ReST filter into MyDescriptionHelpFormatter (argparse text
      formatter that strips out a few very simple styles of markup and leaves us
      with appropriate plain text version for the CLI docs.  Nice!

    Refactor CLI docs

    - Switch to using sphinx-argparse over wonky CLI reference self-generating
      thing.  Enabled some workaround CSS to allow for longer descriptions.
    - Starting converting source docs from Markdown to reStructuredText.
    - Disable the make_cli_docs.py script from pre-commit since this is no longer
      needed.

    NOTE: Docs generation with the argparse add-on only seems to work correctly
    with Python 3.  I'll attempt to update the read-the-docs setting accordingly

    This needs a bunch more work for before merging into to master.  This should
    allow for the slimming down of CLI output and moving more details into a
    one-page doc per subcommand, which should end up being more readable.

This commit resolves issues where submodule issues weren't being reported

for example), which then cause the docs build to fail in a confusing way.

- Add custom warning class:  KsconfPluginWarning that actually shows up when
  there's a problem (unlike ImportWarning, whoops).
- Refactored get_all_ksconf_cmds() to return a new named tuple called
  KsconfCmdEntryPoint to make further refactoring less impactful.  Also this

Expanded existing diff support, and refactored the code to support additional
use cases and improve safety.   The entire commit history is provided, but in
summary:

- Split compare_cfgs() into smaller bits.  Now a diff on individual stanzas is
  supported using the compare_stanzas() function.
- Expand diff header support.  It's now possible to further manipulate headers,
  primarily this is used for setting the modification time for non-file objects.
- Add new TermColor helper to provide context manager support around ANSI color
  manipulation on the terminal.  This reduces the likelihood of bad TTY state.
- Added helper functions:  reduce_stanza() and is_equal()

    Refactor compare_stanza() into private and public parts

    - Split compare_stanzas() into 2 parts.  1 Part is private and used by the
      public version and by compare_cfgs().  The public interface now returns a
      list, not an iterable.

    Add new TermColor helper

    Created a new context-managing class as a replacement for the simple
    tty_color() function.  I ran into an issue in the field where and unhandled
    exception in the diff library (surely caused by something external) left the
    terminal in a hard-to-read color.   And that should just never happen.  This
    context manager should keep this from being an issue.

    Written at 2AM after a 6 hour client working session.  So, do more testing.

Supports:

- Pushing multiple stanzas to a specific config endpoint at once, in a fairly
  efficient process.
- Changes made on the server are show in the form of a diff.  (Eventually, this
  should be configurable, and a dry-run mode should be added.)
- Supports pushing to a live Splunk instance (via Splunkd REST API).  This
  should replace the use of 'rest-export' for MOST use cases.
- Supports reading and applying metadata (ACLs, owner, shared, app) to imported
  objects.
- Any type of conf entry should be supported.

Limitations:

- **NO UNIT TESTING!**  (This will require some fancy mock work.)
- Doesn't support attribute-level metadata.
- No SSL validation setup yet.  This is primarily because of how Splunk's
  Python SDK works.  For other Python HTTP libraries this is enabled by default.

    Fixed small bug in rest-publish

    Resolved issue where 'diff' output would crash if the Splunkd version of the
    stanza contained a blank attribute (which was being returned as a None) which
    was screwing up the show_diff() function.

    - Replace values of None with '' for attributes returned from Splunkd (REST).
      This fixes the core issue in rest-publish.
    - Placed protective code in the show_diff() to be slightly better at handling
      unexpected None values.  This is a secondary protection method that should
      at least NOT CRASH if somehow a None leaks in from somewhere else.

    Fixed bugs in rest-publish

    - Fixed issue where rest-publish would fail if '--conf' wasn't explicitly set.
      Has something to do with encoding.  Splunk SDK is looking for a non-unicode
      value for conf-type.  Whatever.
    - Fixed corner-case thing where ACL has 'read' or 'write' is an empty list.

    Reduce server round-trips for rest-publish

    - Fix ACL diff output (requires some manipulation of the 'access' data to some
      wonky hybrid of (1) what the conf file looks like, (2) what the rest endpoint
      returns, and (3) what the ACL end-point expect.  (Because you know, all 3
      have to be different.)
    - Remove unnecessary ACL endpoint call (due to typo).
    - Remove the 'exists' check per stanza overhead.
    - Fixed an always-update bug that caused an extra round-trip.
    - Improved some output for some error conditions (lots of room for improvement
      here).  Sill no unit tests, and no dry-run mode, ...

    In testing with a simple 4 stanzas file.  I was able to get the best case run
    (where no changes are needed) down from from 17 REST calls down to 5.  Which
    the theoretical best case possible (1 per stanzas plus 1 for login).  First
    pushes will still be slower, at about 13 calls, but this should still feel much
    faster then before.  (Running a few hundred felt quite painful.)

    - Wonky workaround required for splunksdk limitation where posting to the '/acl'

    Still no unit-tests for rest-publish, and I'm not sure if mock is enough to
    handle this complex mess!  (I'm really not excited about launching a Splunk
    instance from within Travis CI, either.)

- Add note demonstrating the use of the pre-commit ""SKIP"" mechanism.
- Note a workaround for 'git ksdiff' if the 'git-difftool' command isn't

5fce783cadb8f554abdbd8e054115724f2b87715,"Fix diff textual output bug

This resolves a long-term bug where the diff output of a single-line attribute
change was incorrectly represented in the textual output of 'ksconf diff' and
the diff output in other commands. Closes #18.

Known to impact:  'diff', and dry-run output of 'combine' and 'merge'
Likely impacted:  'promote'

Note that the API technically handled this correctly, only the textual diff
output was wrong.  While this has been an open bug for quite some time, I
suspect this issue re-surfaced now due to an API level bug recently fixed in
1c9a974f6 (released in 0.7.3).  Likely these two bugs were masking each others
existence, but since they weren't complete opposites, so they didn't fully
cancel each other out either.

The diff output has been therefore reversed in a place or two (which should
correct possible weird '--dry-run' output in both combine and merge) where it
was previously incorrect.

Several unit tests have been added and existing ones improved to lock down the
now correct behavior and prevent future regressions.",Lowell Alleman,lowell@kintyre.co,Lowell Alleman,lowell@kintyre.co,2019-06-28 17:23:16-04:00,14400,2019-07-03 16:40:14-04:00,14400,True,False,"['delta.py', 'merge.py', 'test_cli_combine.py', 'test_cli_diff.py', 'test_cli_merge.py']",['70f2b69358dbd1d20b571283ca4e7f99fd23dced'],11,33,44,5,0.0,1.0,1.0

Created a context manager for conf file editing. Now you can write something
like this, and reading/update is handled automatically:

    with update_conf(path) as conf:
        conf[""stanza""][""disabled""] = ""true""

Many enhancements to the 'ksconf package' command:

- Implement blacklisting.  Added support for blacklist files (like .gitignore)
- Setting of app version and build.
- Overwrite app folder name, helpful when the source is '.'
- Implement 2 (out of 3) local handling options.  (Merge, the default is still
  not implemented, and no existing merge/combine logic will work here, because
  the destination is also a source.)
- Advanced build options:  (1) Creation of a ""release"" file which is written
  with the path to the created tarball, and (2) hook script/command integration
  for things like running ""pip install"" to download required 3rd party library
  during the build.
- Added some ""magic"" variable outputs for the app name.  So you can include
  the latest git HEAD ref, or extract the app.conf version, or name of the
  latest git tag, ... (Fully undocumented at the moment, but eventually it will
  be self describing).

It's becoming more obvious that I need a ""SplunkApp"" abstraction of some kind
to handle simple Splunk-like access to conf files collected within an app,
where reading things from default/local can be merged automatically upon read.
This could also include stanza updates, local->default merging, and some other
features I've added to package.py but should really be refactored elsewhere,
but I wanted to start by saving off a working version :=)  Ideally this
abstraction could be applied to tarball files too (allow for some reuse between
here and 'unarchive', for example.)

- Move all magic variable expansion from the package cli code into the
  AppPackager() class.
- Update the temporary 'app_dir' directory handling logic so that (1) app_name
  can be expanded using placeholder variables, and (2) if the app name is '.'
  or contains place holder variables, it will be placed in a folder named 'app'
  and then stored with the correct top-level name when written to the tarball.
- Expand output messages from AppPackager so that variable substitutions are
  shown along with the template value that was expanded.
- **CLI change to ksconf package**  Replaced short option ""-w"" with ""-a"" for
  ""--allowlist"".   (I think this was left over from when the argument was
  called '--whitelist') Give that 0.8.0 has only been released for less than 4
  days, I'm going to assume that no one has relied too heavily upon this option
  just yet.
- Add some initial safety checks to AppPackager.  This checks for hidden (.)
  files and it will also set or validate the app folder name against the value
  in 'id' under apps.conf [package].  If the package id doesn't match the
  folder name when 'check_for_updates' is true, then the assumption is that the
  package is destined for Splunkbase and therefore such a discrepancy should be
  considered fatal.
- Update package unit tests slightly: (1) to avoid writing tarballs to the git
  working directory root, and (2) fixed typo in tarfile open `r"":gz"" should
  have been `""r:gz""` ;-)

reason to discard empty stanzas blindly, my prior attempt to preserve backwards

- Added new 'calculate_signature()' method to layer classes (at the file and
  collection level) so that an fingerprint of an app can be built to
  efficiently determine if anything changes between two moments in time.  (This
  is slated to replace the build.cache.FileSet() functionality, at least for the
  use of cdillc.splunk.ksconf_package)
- Add new 'from_*' alternate constructors to AppPackager and LayerCombiner so
  that these classes can be used against existing LayerRootBase instances
  instead of relying on these classes to build their own.  This is a subtle
  change, but it greatly improves object reuse in certain scenarios where layer
  objects must be built ahead of time for other purposes such as change
  detection.  The main beneficiary is the aforementioned ansible action.
