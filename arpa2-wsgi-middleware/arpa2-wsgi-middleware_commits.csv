For details, see draft-vanrein-http-unauth-user
 - The User header holds a resource-selecting user (with % escaping)
 - This is a server-side user (authentication is a client-side user)
 - Remove % escapes, check syntax and store in LOCAL_USER
 - When provided (and possibly used), add ""Vary: User"" to the response
 - Default syntax check is against NAI, though not yet UTF-8 compliant
 - Additionally facilitated are empty strings (by default at least)
