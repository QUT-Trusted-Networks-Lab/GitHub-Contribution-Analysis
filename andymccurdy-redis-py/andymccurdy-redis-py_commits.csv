b1651bab349004fffe6460f7fbb306ea6e2c4dc8,"Added socket disconnection if commands are rejected due to AOF/RDB load.

SELECT commands are issued only on initial socket connection. If a user issues a command during an AOF/RDB load, the socket connection will be successfully opened, but the SELECT command will be lost.

If ""client"" is a pipeline, and this pipeline is empty, python converts ""client"" to False when casting in bool because Class BasePipeline has a method __len__. 
""client"" is reset to self.registered_client, and the script is not executed in the pipeline as it should.
The correct test is to check if ""client"" equals None.

Users now have the ability about how socket.timeout errors are handled.
Previously socket.timeout errors were handled just like any other socket error
in that the command would be retried once. This createed a potential race
condition when the client sends a command to a busy Redis server that can't
reply faster than the client's `socket_timeout` option. In this case, the server
will still eventually process the command.

There's now a `retry_on_timeout` option that's set to False by default.
If `retry_on_timeout` is False, any socket.timeout error will raise a
TimeoutError exception. If `retry_on_timeout` is set to True, the client
will retry executing the command once just like other socket.error exceptions.

TODO: Write better tests for this code.
TODO: Much of this logic could/should be moved to the ConnectionPool or
      Connection objects.

formerly resulted in a confusing crash, ""AttributeError: 'NoneType'

clarifies what the calling code forgot to do.

36a84fc9ac4e06a9b85ccc4e4eda426b387c7093,"remove legacy Redis class

redis-py maintained backwards compatibility by keeping the old ""Redis""
class around for quite some time. While no doubt a convenience for folks
who relied on it, the presence of both Redis and StrictRedis causes
a number of support issues and general confusion. With 3.0, we're
breaking a few things to make redis-py better going forward.

This change removes the old Redis class. We also renamed the StrictRedis
class to Redis and aliased StrictRedis to Redis. For people that have
been using StrictRedis, this should not change anything. You can continue
doing things as you are.

People still using the legacy Redis class will need to update the argument
order for the SETEX, LREM and ZADD commands. Additionally, the return values
for TTL and PTTL now return the integer values -1 when a key exists but
has no expire time and -2 when a key does not exist. Previously these
cases returned a None value in the Redis class.",Andy McCurdy,andy@andymccurdy.com,Andy McCurdy,andy@andymccurdy.com,2018-11-13 16:44:36-08:00,28800,2018-11-13 16:44:36-08:00,28800,True,False,"['README.rst', 'base.py', 'basic_operations.py', 'client.py', 'sentinel.py', 'conftest.py', 'test_commands.py', 'test_connection_pool.py', 'test_lock.py', 'test_pipeline.py', 'test_sentinel.py']",['90a52dd5de111f0053bb3ebaa7c78f73a82a1e3e'],285,191,476,11,0.0,0.0,0.92

All input sent to Redis is coerced into bytes. This includes key names and
values. Prior to this change, redis-py made an effort to cooerce all input
into strings by calling str() (Python 3) or unicode() (Python 2). While this
works for a handful of types like ints, longs and floats, it fails for other
types like bools ('True' or 'False'), None ('None') and many user defined
types.

Starting with redis-py version 3.0, sending input of any other type is
considered an error an a DataError exception will be raised.

4e1e74809235edc19e03edb79c97c80a3e4e9eca,"Improve how connection pools operate in forked/child proceeses.

Sometimes a process with an active connection to Redis forks and creates
child processes taht also want to talk to Redis. Prior to this change there
were a number of potential conflicts that could cause this to fail.

Retrieving a connection from the pool and releasing a connection back
to the pool check the current proceeses PID. If it's different than the
PID that created the pool, reset() is called to get a fresh set of connections
for the current process. However in doing so, pool.disconnect() was caused
which closes the file descriptors that the parent may still be using. Further
when the available_connections and in_use_connections lists are reset, all of
those connections inherited from the parent are GC'd and the connection's
`__del__` was called, which also closed the socket and file descriptor.

This change prevents pool.disconnect() from being called when a pid is changed.
It also removes the `__del__` destructor from connections. Neither of these
are necessary or practical. Child processes still reset() their copy of the
pool when first accessed causing their own connections to be created.

`ConnectionPool.disconnect()` now checks the current process ID
so that a child or parent can't disconnect the other's connections.

Additionally, `Connection.disconnect()` now checks the current process ID
and only calls `socket.shutdown()` if `disconnect()` is called by the same
process that created the connection. This allows for a child process that
inherited a connection to call `Connection.disconnect()` and not shutdown
the parent's copy of the socket.

Adds redis.selector, a module that provides the best selector strategy
available on the current platform. A redis.selector polls a socket to
provide two pieces of functionality:

1. Check whether data can be read from the socket. Prior versions of redis-py
provided this behavior with just select.select(). select() has lots of
limitations, most notably a limit of ~1024 file descriptors. Now that
better selectors are available, this should make can_read() faster and
able to accomodate more clients. See #1115 and #486

2. Check whether a socket is ready for a command to be sent. This doubles
as a health check. It ensures that the socket is available for writing,
has no data to read and has no known errors. Anytime a socket is
disconnected or hung up, data is available to be read, typically zero bytes.

ConnectionPool.get_connection has been modified to ensure that connections
it returns are connected and are ready for a command to be sent. If
get_connection encounters a case where a socket isn't ready for a command
the connection is reconnected and checked again.

TODO: more tests for this stuff. implement EPoll and KQueue selectors.

f60b2b07caba276b9308340b8ea06e5844f3f0ab,"PING/PONG health checks

The `Redis` class and the `ConnectionPool` class now support the
""health_check_interval=N"" option. By default N=0, which turns off health
checks. `N` should be an integer, and when greater than 0, ensures that
a health check is performed just before command execution anytime the
underlying connection has been idle for more than N seconds. A health
check is a full PING/PONG round trip to the Redis server.

If a health check encounters a ConnectionError or TimeoutError, the connection
is disconnected and reconnected and the health check is retried exactly once.
Any error during the retry is raised to the caller. Health check retries
are not governed by any other options such as `retry_on_timeout`. In systems
where idle times are common, these health checks are the intended way to
reconnect to the Redis server without harming any user data.

When this option is enabled for PubSub connections, calling `get_message()` or
`listen()` will send a health check anytime a message has not been read on
the PubSub connection for `health_check_interval` seconds. Users should
call `get_message()` or `listen()` at least every `health_check_interval`
seconds in order to keep the connection open.",Andy McCurdy,andy@andymccurdy.com,Andy McCurdy,andy@andymccurdy.com,2019-07-23 16:54:26-07:00,25200,2019-07-28 12:39:13-07:00,25200,True,False,"['CHANGES', 'client.py', 'connection.py', 'test_commands.py', 'test_connection_pool.py']",['0984b102264b2600a6534ad8fef6f4cab44b4ecc'],28,275,303,5,0.5857988165680473,0.6745562130177515,0.7514792899408284

Prior to ACL support, redis-py ignored the username component of
Connection URLs. With ACL support, usernames are no longer ignored and
are used to authenticate against an ACL rule. Some cloud vendors with

username component pre-ACL that is not intended to be used. Sending that
username to Redis servers < 6.0.0 results in an error. Attempt to detect
this condition and retry the AUTH command with only the password such

If an exception occurs inside the __del__ method, it should be reported

Python automatically handles exceptions inside __del__ methods, for
example:

            1 / 0

    A()

1. All make targets are now PHONY.

2. Cleaned up the 'dev' target so that it passes --build
   to docker-compose.

3. Added pypy-specific tox environments. And added a new
   Dockerfile to build an image for the ""test"" container
   that contains pypy and pypy3.

4. Added a `make clean` target. It removes containers but
   requires the user to confirm.

5. Specify the depends_on order for slave -> master and
   made all sentinels depend on the slave coming up. The
   container running doesn't mean that redis is actually
   ready though, so I wrapped the ""test"" target in the
   Makefile with a wait script that waits until

Remove support for end-of-life Python 2.7

Python 2.7 is end of life. It is no longer receiving bug fixes,
including for security issues. Python 2.7 went EOL on 2020-01-01. For
additional details on support Python versions, see:

Supported: https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches
EOL: https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches

Removing support for EOL Pythons will reduce testing and maintenance
resources while allowing the library to move towards a modern Python 3
style. Python 2.7 users can continue to use the previous version of
redis-py.

Was able to simplify the code:

- Removed redis._compat module
- Removed __future__ imports
- Removed object from class definition (all classes are new style)
- Removed long (Python 3 unified numeric types)
- Removed deprecated __nonzero__ method
- Use simpler Python 3 super() syntax
- Use unified OSError exception

e635130043d7657d9bee6911995f649e2de9eb04,"🕰️ Use monotonic clock in Lock (and tests)

During a call to `acquire()`, if the call is `blocking` and has a
`blocking_timeout` set, it uses `time.time()` calls to determine when to
give up attempting to acquire the lock.

However, since `time.time()` is marked as ""adjustable"", it is possible
for it to go backwards or forwards at a rate other than 1 second per
second, meaning the spinloop may exit earlier or later than expected.

By changing the implementation to use `time.monotonic()`, which is
guaranteed to never go backwards, and not be affected by system clock
updates, this potential problem is fixed.

For the same reason, some time dependent lock tests have also been
changed to use `time.monotonic()`.",Jack Edge,yellowbounder@gmail.com,Roey Prat,roey.prat@redislabs.com,2020-09-24 15:34:19+01:00,-3600,2020-10-12 19:07:10+03:00,-10800,True,False,"['lock.py', 'test_lock.py']",['e4067e8b4441b512cab35039e41160b8a6e3c462'],6,6,12,2,,,

* Fix warnings and resource usage problems in asyncio unittests (#2258)

* Use pytest-asyncio in auto mode
Remove overly genereric `pytestmark=pytest.mark.asyncio` causing lots of warning noise

* Use ""Factories as Fixtures"" test pattern for the `create_redis` fixture
this fixture is now async, avoiding teardown problems with missing event loops.

* Fix sporadic error on fast event loops, such as `--uvloop`

* Close connection, even if ""username"" was in kwargs
This fixes a resource usage warning in the async unittests.

* Do async cleanup of acl passwords via a fixture

* Remove unused import, fix whitespace

* Fix test with missing ""await""

* Close pubsub objects after use in unittest
Use a simple fixture where possible, otherwise manually call pubsub.close()

* re-introduce `pytestmark=pytest.mark.asyncio` for python 3.6

* Use context manager to clean up connections in connection pool for unit tests

* Provide asynccontextmanager for python 3.6

* make `test_late_subscribe()` more robuste

* Catch a couple of additional leaked resources

* async_cluster: fix max_connections/ssl & improve args (#2217)

* async_cluster: fix max_connections/ssl & improve args

- set proper connection_class if ssl = True
- pass max_connections/connection_class to ClusterNode
- recreate startup_nodes to properly initialize
- pass parser_class to Connection instead of changing it in on_connect
- only pass redis_connect_func if read_from_replicas = True
- add connection_error_retry_attempts parameter
- skip is_connected check in acquire_connection as it is already checked in send_packed_command

BREAKING:
- RedisCluster args except host & port are kw-only now
- RedisCluster will no longer accept unknown arguments
- RedisCluster will no longer accept url as an argument. Use RedisCluster.from_url
- RedisCluster.require_full_coverage defaults to True
- ClusterNode args except host, port, & server_type are kw-only now

* async_cluster: remove kw-only requirement from client

* Fix timezone handling for datetime to unixtime conversions

datetime objects are supported to set expire, these can have timezones.
mktime was used to convert these to unixtime. mktime in Python however is not timezone aware, it expects the input to be UTC and redis-py did not convert the datetime timestamps to UTC before calling mktime.

This can lead to:
1) Setting incorrect expire times because the input datetime object has a timezone but is passed to mktime without converting to UTC first.
2) When the datetime timestamp is within DST, mktime fails with ""OverflowError: mktime argument out of range"" because UTC doesn't have DST. This depends on libc versions.

The error message implied that urls had to start with `scheme://`.
However, if the double slash was left out, the url parsed just fine
and the part that was ostensibly intended to be the hostname ended
up as part of the path, whereas the default (localhost) would be
used for the hostname. This commit makes the check as strict as the
error message implies by including a check for the double slash.

When using special response parsing options like `NEVER_DECODE` and
`EMPTY_RESPONSE`, don't pass them to the response callbacks because some

Instead, redis-py should use them before calling the callbacks and
then discard them.

There's an issue in asyncio's timeout lib before 3.11.3 that causes
async calls to raise `CancelledError`.

This is a cpython issue that was fixed in this commit [1] and
cherry-picked to previous versions, meaning 3.11.3 will work correctly.

Check [2] for more info.

When the disconnect() function is called twice in parallel it is possible that
one thread deletes the self._sock reference, while the other thread will
attempt to call .close() on it, leading to an AttributeError.

This situation can routinely be encountered by closing the connection in a
PubSubWorkerThread error handler in a blocking thread (ie. with
sleep_time==None), and then calling .close() on the PubSub object.
The main thread will then run into the disconnect() function, and the listener
thread is woken up by the closure and will race into the disconnect()
function, too.

* fix: do not use asyncio's timeout lib before 3.11.2 (#2659)

There's an issue in asyncio's timeout lib before 3.11.3 that causes
async calls to raise `CancelledError`.

This is a cpython issue that was fixed in this commit [1] and
cherry-picked to previous versions, meaning 3.11.3 will work correctly.

Check [2] for more info.

* Really do not use asyncio's timeout lib before 3.11.2 (#2699)

480253037afe4c12e38a0f98cadd3019a3724254 made async-timeout required
only on Python 3.11.2 and earlier. However, according to PEP-508,
python_version marker is compared to first two numbers of Python version
tuple - so it will evaluate to True also on 3.11.3, and install a
package as a dependency.

* Fix incorrect usage of once flag in async Sentinel (#2718)

In the execute_command of the async Sentinel, the once flag was being
used incorrectly, with its meaning inverted. To fix we just needed to invert
the if and else bodies. This isn't being caught by the tests currently
because the tests of commands that use this flag do not check their
results/effects (for example the ""test_ckquorum"" test).

* Fix potential race condition during disconnection (#2719)

When the disconnect() function is called twice in parallel it is possible that
one thread deletes the self._sock reference, while the other thread will
attempt to call .close() on it, leading to an AttributeError.

This situation can routinely be encountered by closing the connection in a
PubSubWorkerThread error handler in a blocking thread (ie. with
sleep_time==None), and then calling .close() on the PubSub object.
The main thread will then run into the disconnect() function, and the listener
thread is woken up by the closure and will race into the disconnect()
function, too.

This can be fixed easily by copying the object reference before doing the
None-check, similar to what we do in the redis.client.close() function.

* Support query timeout = 0

In RediSearch query timeout = 0 means unlimited timeout.
In the current implementation, the query timeout is only updated `if timeout` which in case of 0, translates to false.
Since the default timeout of the `query` class is None, replacing the condition with `if self._timeout is not None` will also work for 0.
If the parameter is not a positive integer, redis server will raise an exception.

* raise an exception if query TIMEOUT is a non negative integer

This won't meaningfully affect most users, so I won't feel bad if this
is closed :-)

It's often important for performance to control when garbage collection
runs and to reduce the need to run garbage collection in the first
place.

During AbstractionConnection.on_connect, it's common to raise and catch
ResponseError, since e.g. CLIENT SETINFO is very new. However, because
response is in a local, it creates ref cycles that keep all locals in
all calling stack frames alive.

The use of a local to store the exception is unfortunate, since
exceptions hold references to their tracebacks, which hold references to
the relevant frames, which holds a reference to the local exception.
See https://peps.python.org/pep-0344/#open-issue-garbage-collection
and https://peps.python.org/pep-3110/#rationale

This breaks the cycle by deleting the local when we raise, so frames are
destroyed by the normal reference counting mechanism.",Shantanu,12621235+hauntsaninja@users.noreply.github.com,GitHub,noreply@github.com,2023-09-14 06:32:04-07:00,25200,2023-09-14 16:32:04+03:00,-10800,True,False,['connection.py'],['ba186d210f4f1e5d16fb27a1ee0afcb930f16a8d'],1,4,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0
